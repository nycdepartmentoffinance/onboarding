# Helpful Resources

## Learning R

-   Why R?

    -   [Urban Institute's Intro to
        R](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/r-at-urban/intro-to-r.html):
        very high level overview of how it works and RStudio

    -   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html):
        just read the introduction to start

-   Introduction courses in R

    -   [Introduction to
        R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
        (online course): very basic, but goes over assignment, data
        types, etc.

    -   [Intro to tidyverse in
        R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse)
        (online course): datacamp class by a good instructor that walks
        through all the typical operations you'd do for data analysis
        and extremely basic data visualization

    -   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
        (book with exercises, self-paced): a very in depth walk through
        by the main developer of R. I find this to be the best resource
        -- both in how simple it is and how well it's explained. There
        are also some exercises sprinkled throughout. If you want the
        solutions to the exercises, here is a solution key:
        <https://ui-research.github.io/r4ds-exercises/index.html>

-   Modeling in R

    -   [Tidy modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/ames): an example of
        modeling in R using housing data -- and how to think about/use
        model objects in R

    -   [mixed
        models](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/random_intercepts.html):
        clear explanation of how hierarchical or mixed models work in R

    -   [splines](https://bookdown.org/ssjackson300/Machine-Learning-Lecture-Notes/splines.html):
        also a clear explanation of how splines are working in R

-   Essential reference materials

    -   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html):
        as shared above, extremely helpful

    -   [Introduction to Data and Exploration and Analysis with
        R](https://bookdown.org/mikemahoney218/IDEAR/): this is another
        introduction book, but has a really nice chapter on modeling

    -   [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/): basically all I needed to
        figure out how to build the R package assessNYC
